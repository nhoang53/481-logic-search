# 481-logic-search
Group 2:
1.	Consider the master finding logic search example from module 2 part 4. Code a search system that works with the original system of 9 statements and correctly determines the location of fred given the logic and user answers to the questions
“What day of the week is it?”
If its Saturday then ask “Is it cold today?”
“What kind of dog is fred?”
If fred is collie then ask “Is fred trained?”
Assume that Sam is fred’s master.
You may use or adapt my unify function if needed.
1.	Be sure to post your python code text directly into the rich text editor, as well as linking the py file. We should be able to read your code from the discussion forum, or download it and test it as we’d like.
Group 1:
1.	First peer review their code and make comments/corrections as needed
2.	Then add more logic to the system and their code and be sure you get the correct answer by including
1.	More dog breed options.( Its up to your judgement how to determine if they’re good)
2.	A question for who’s the dogs master (remove the assumption that sam is fred’s master)
3.	more day/weather options (Where else might someone be with their dog based on the day/weather)
